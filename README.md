# Welcome to Habitsy - Your Personal Habit Tracker!
 
 
Habitsy is an innovative habit tracking application designed to help you achieve your goals and lead a more productive and fulfilling life. With Habitsy, you can easily track your daily habits and monitor your progress towards building a positive and healthy routine.

Habitsy offers three states to track your habits: "Done," "Not Done," and "None." With a simple swipe or tap, you can mark your habit as "Done" when you successfully complete it. If you're unable to accomplish the habit on a particular day, you can mark it as "Not Done." And if you decide to skip a habit for a day, you can select the "None" option. These three states provide flexibility, acknowledging that life can sometimes be unpredictable.
